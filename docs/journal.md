## 2025-09-18 14:23:05 - Production Server SSH Connection Issue

### Context
Attempting to troubleshoot production environment on Docker server 10.60.10.56, but encountering SSH connectivity issues.

### Issue Discovered
- **Server reachable**: Ping successful (8ms response time)
- **SSH port 22**: Connection failed - port appears to be blocked or SSH service not running
- **Alternative SSH port 2222**: Also failed
- **HTTP port 80**: Successfully accessible - web service is running
- **Web response**: Returns HTTP 200 with what appears to be default IIS page

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
1. Network connectivity test - ✅ Server is reachable
2. SSH port 22 test - ❌ Connection failed
3. Alternative SSH port 2222 test - ❌ Connection failed  
4. HTTP port 80 test - ✅ Web service responding
5. Web service check - Returns default page, not our application

### Possible Causes
1. SSH service not installed/configured on Windows Docker server
2. Windows Firewall blocking SSH ports
3. SSH running on non-standard port
4. Server might be Windows-based requiring different access method (RDP, WinRM)

### Next steps
- Verify server OS type and available access methods
- Check if WinRM/PowerShell remoting is available
- Consider alternative deployment methods if SSH unavailable
- Verify current application deployment status

// Database SSL Configuration Fix
```bash
# Updated .env.production
DB_ENCRYPT=true
DB_TRUST_CERT=true  # Changed from false to true
```

// API Key Decryption Fix
1. **Created diagnostic script**: `backend/src/scripts/fixApiKeys.ts`
   - Analyzes encryption/decryption issues
   - Safely clears corrupted encrypted data
   - Provides clear remediation steps

2. **Executed fix script**:
   - Identified corrupted Gemini and OpenAI API keys
   - Cleared broken encrypted data from `settings.json`
   - Preserved settings structure for re-entry

## 2025-09-18 13:50:42 - Docker Environment Configuration

### Context
Created comprehensive Docker environment configurations for development, staging, and production deployments with proper network share handling.

### What was done

#### 1. Updated Base Docker Compose Configuration
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use Docker mount path `/app/shared`
- Added `shared_storage` volume mount to backend service
- Added volumes section with placeholder configuration

#### 2. Created Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment (`docker-compose.development.yml`)**
- Uses local directory binding for shared storage
- Enables hot reload for development
- No CIFS mounting required
- Created `./backend/shared-dev` directory for local testing

**Staging Environment (`docker-compose.staging.yml`)**
- Mirrors production setup for testing
- Uses CIFS mounting with domain credentials
- Separate staging database configuration
- Created `.env.staging` with staging-specific settings

**Production Environment (`docker-compose.production.yml`)**
- CIFS network share mounting with domain authentication
- Production database and security settings
- Updated `.env.production` with Docker mount paths

#### 3. Created Deployment Scripts

**Development Deployment (`deploy-development.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Uses local shared storage, no network dependencies
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build -d
```

**Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Tests CIFS mounting before production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

**Production Deployment (`deploy-production.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Full production deployment with network share
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build -d
```

#### 4. Created Documentation
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment configuration explanations
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Security considerations and monitoring commands

### Technical Details

**CIFS Volume Configuration:**
```yaml
volumes:
  shared_storage:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "username=${DOMAIN_USERNAME},password=${DOMAIN_PASSWORD},domain=mbma.com,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777"
      device: "//mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia"
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `SHARED_FOLDER_PATH=/app/shared` (Docker mount path)
- `ORIGINAL_SHARED_PATH=\\\\mbma.com\\shared\\...` (Reference)
- `DOMAIN_USERNAME=mbma\prfservice`
- `DOMAIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!`

### Files Modified/Created
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated base configuration
- `docker-compose.development.yml` - New development config
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` - New staging config
- `backend/.env.staging` - New staging environment
- `deploy-development.ps1` - New development deployment script
- `deploy-staging.ps1` - New staging deployment script
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - New deployment documentation
- `backend/shared-dev/` - New development shared directory

### Next Steps
1. Test Docker container network share access in staging environment
2. Validate CIFS mounting with domain credentials
3. Deploy updated Docker configuration to production
4. Monitor network share performance in containerized environment

### Impact
- Enables proper Docker deployment across all environments

## 2025-09-20 06:37:33 - Network Share Access Solution for Docker

**Context:** Backend was failing to access Windows network share files from Docker container. Error: `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when trying to access paths like `/mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia/34076/PRF 34076 - PC for CCP Control Room.pdf`. The issue was that Linux containers cannot directly access Windows UNC paths.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Database contains file paths in format: `/mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/...`
- Docker container (Linux) cannot access Windows UNC paths directly
- Mounting as volume would require changing all database file paths (not desired)

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **CIFS Mounting at Container Startup:**
   - Created `backend/scripts/mount-network-share.sh` to mount Windows share
   - Created `backend/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` as container entrypoint
   - Mounts network share to exact path: `/mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia`

2. **Docker Configuration Updates:**
   - Updated `backend/Dockerfile` to install `su-exec` and copy scripts
   - Modified `docker-compose.yml` backend service:
     - Run as `root` (required for mounting)
     - Added `SYS_ADMIN` capability
     - Enabled `privileged: true` mode
     - Added environment variables for share configuration

3. **Environment Variables:**
   `ash
   DOMAIN_USERNAME=mti\administrator
   DOMAIN_PASSWORD=Bl4ck3y34dmin
   SHARE_HOST=mbma.com
   SHARE_PATH=shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia
   `

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/scripts/mount-network-share.sh` - Network share mounting script
- `backend/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` - Container startup script
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Added CIFS support and entrypoint
- `docker-compose.yml` - Backend service configuration for mounting

**How It Works:**
1. Container starts as root
2. Entrypoint script mounts Windows share to `/mbma.com/shared/...`
3. Application switches to nodejs user and starts
4. File paths in database work directly (no changes needed)

**Benefits:**
-  No database migration required
-  Existing file paths work unchanged
-  Secure authentication with domain credentials
-  Automatic mounting on container startup

**Next Steps:**
- Test deployment on production Docker server
- Verify file access functionality
- Monitor mount stability and performance

## 2025-09-20 08:05:51 - CIFS Mount Troubleshooting on Production

### Context
Testing CIFS mounting functionality on production Docker server (10.60.10.59) to resolve network share access issues. The backend container needs to mount Windows share `//mbma.com/shared` to access PRF documents.

### Container Diagnostics Performed
1. **Network Connectivity**: ✅ Container can reach mbma.com
2. **CIFS Utilities**: ✅ cifs-utils package installed and functional
3. **Kernel Modules**: ✅ CIFS kernel support available
4. **Mount Point**: ✅ Test directory `/tmp/test-mount` created successfully

### Mount Testing Results
**Manual Mount Attempts:**
- `vers=3.0, sec=ntlmssp`: ❌ "Required key not available" (error 126)
- `vers=1.0, sec=ntlm`: ❌ "Invalid argument" (error 22)
- `vers=2.0, sec=none`: ❌ "Required key not available" (error 126)
- `vers=2.1, sec=ntlmssp`: ❌ "Required key not available" (error 126)
- `vers=1.0 with credentials file`: ❌ "Required key not available" (error 126)

### Cryptographic Module Analysis
- **Issue Found**: Container lacks NTLM cryptographic modules
- **Available Crypto**: AES, HMAC, Blake2b algorithms present
- **Missing**: NTLM/NTLMSSP authentication modules (common in Alpine Linux)

### Authentication Testing
**Installed samba-client for testing:**
```bash
apk add samba-client  # 42 packages installed successfully
```

**SMB Connection Test:**
```bash
smbclient -L //mbma.com -U ict.supportassistant%'Bl4ck3y34dmin' -W mbma
# Result: NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Account Lockout**: Multiple failed mount attempts locked the `ict.supportassistant` account
2. **Missing Crypto Modules**: Alpine Linux container lacks NTLM authentication support
3. **Security Requirements**: Windows share requires NTLM/NTLMSSP authentication

### Root Cause Analysis
The production environment has stricter security policies than development:
- Account lockout after failed authentication attempts
- NTLM cryptographic modules not available in Alpine Linux base image
- Windows domain authentication requirements

### Next Steps
1. **Account Recovery**: Contact IT to unlock `ict.supportassistant` account
2. **Alternative Authentication**: Test with different domain account or service account
3. **Container Image**: Consider using Ubuntu-based image with full NTLM support
4. **Security Review**: Verify domain authentication requirements and policies

### Technical Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Use Ubuntu/Debian base image with full CIFS/NTLM support
2. **Security**: Implement service account with limited privileges for mounting
3. **Monitoring**: Add mount status checks and automatic retry logic
4. **Fallback**: Consider alternative file access methods if CIFS mounting fails

## 2025-09-20 08:09:14 - Credential Correction

### Issue Identified
**CRITICAL ERROR**: Used wrong credentials during testing!

**Wrong credentials used in testing:**
- Username: `ict.supportassistant`
- Password: `Bl4ck3y34dmin`

**Correct credentials from .env.production:**
- Username: `mbma\ict.supportassistant`
- Password: `P@ssw0rd.123`

### Impact
This explains the authentication failures during CIFS mount testing. The "NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT" error was likely due to using incorrect username, not actual account lockout.

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test CIFS mounting with correct credentials (`mbma\ict.supportassistant`)
2. **Verify**: Check if Alpine Linux container can authenticate with correct credentials
3. **Proceed**: If still fails, continue with Ubuntu base image plan

---

## 2025-09-20 08:12:22 - DFS Limitation Discovery

### Critical Finding: Linux CIFS Does Not Support DFS

**Root Cause Identified**: Linux CIFS clients do not support Microsoft DFS (Distributed File System).

**Impact**: 
- Path `//mbma.com/shared` appears to be a DFS namespace
- Linux containers cannot resolve DFS paths to actual physical servers
- This explains all mounting failures regardless of credentials or crypto modules

**Evidence**:
- Credentials work perfectly with `smbclient` (can list shares)
- `shared` share not visible in share enumeration (typical of DFS)
- Consistent "Required key not available" errors across all mount attempts

**Solution Required**:
- Find the actual physical server hosting the shared folder
- Use direct server path instead of DFS namespace
- Format: `//actual-server-ip/share-name` instead of `//mbma.com/shared`

---

## 2025-09-20 08:16:51 - Correct Server Path Identified

### Actual Server Path Discovered

**Correct Path**: `\\10.60.10.44\pr_document\PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia`

**Key Changes**:
- Server: `10.60.10.44` (not mbma.com DFS)
- Share: `pr_document` (not shared)
- Path: `PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia` (same subfolder)

**Next Steps**:
1. Update `.env.production` with correct server path ✅
2. Test CIFS mounting with direct server IP ✅
3. Verify application can access the network share

---

## 2025-09-20 08:33:17 - Account Lockout Issue Discovered

### Problem Identified
During CIFS mounting tests, discovered that the `ict.supportassistant` account is locked out:
```
CIFS: Status code returned 0xc0000234 STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT
CIFS: VFS: \\10.60.10.44 Send error in SessSetup = -13
```

### Technical Details
- **Server**: 10.60.10.44
- **Share**: pr_document  
- **Account**: mbma\ict.supportassistant
- **Error**: STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT (0xc0000234)
- **Mount attempts**: All failed with permission denied due to locked account

### Root Cause
The service account `ict.supportassistant` has been locked out, likely due to:
1. Multiple failed authentication attempts
2. Password policy violations
3. Administrative action

### Resolution Required
**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. **Unlock the account**: Contact domain administrator to unlock `mbma\ict.supportassistant`
2. **Verify credentials**: Confirm the password is still `Bl4ck3y34dmin`
3. **Check account status**: Ensure account is enabled and not expired
4. **Test authentication**: Verify account works before proceeding

### Alternative Solutions
If account cannot be unlocked immediately:
1. **Use different service account** with access to `\\10.60.10.44\pr_document`
2. **Create new service account** specifically for this application
3. **Request temporary access** with different credentials

### Current Status
- ✅ Network connectivity confirmed (ping successful, port 445 open)
- ✅ CIFS utilities available in container
- ✅ Container has proper privileges (SYS_ADMIN, privileged mode)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Service account locked out

### Next Steps
1. **Contact IT administrator** to unlock `ict.supportassistant` account
2. Test CIFS mounting once account is unlocked
3. Update mount script with working credentials
4. Verify application functionality
