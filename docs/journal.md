## 2025-09-18 14:23:05 - Production Server SSH Connection Issue

### Context
Attempting to troubleshoot production environment on Docker server 10.60.10.56, but encountering SSH connectivity issues.

### Issue Discovered
- **Server reachable**: Ping successful (8ms response time)
- **SSH port 22**: Connection failed - port appears to be blocked or SSH service not running
- **Alternative SSH port 2222**: Also failed
- **HTTP port 80**: Successfully accessible - web service is running
- **Web response**: Returns HTTP 200 with what appears to be default IIS page

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
1. Network connectivity test - ✅ Server is reachable
2. SSH port 22 test - ❌ Connection failed
3. Alternative SSH port 2222 test - ❌ Connection failed  
4. HTTP port 80 test - ✅ Web service responding
5. Web service check - Returns default page, not our application

### Possible Causes
1. SSH service not installed/configured on Windows Docker server
2. Windows Firewall blocking SSH ports
3. SSH running on non-standard port
4. Server might be Windows-based requiring different access method (RDP, WinRM)

### Next steps
- Verify server OS type and available access methods
- Check if WinRM/PowerShell remoting is available
- Consider alternative deployment methods if SSH unavailable
- Verify current application deployment status

// Database SSL Configuration Fix
```bash
# Updated .env.production
DB_ENCRYPT=true
DB_TRUST_CERT=true  # Changed from false to true
```

// API Key Decryption Fix
1. **Created diagnostic script**: `backend/src/scripts/fixApiKeys.ts`
   - Analyzes encryption/decryption issues
   - Safely clears corrupted encrypted data
   - Provides clear remediation steps

2. **Executed fix script**:
   - Identified corrupted Gemini and OpenAI API keys
   - Cleared broken encrypted data from `settings.json`
   - Preserved settings structure for re-entry

## 2025-09-18 13:50:42 - Docker Environment Configuration

### Context
Created comprehensive Docker environment configurations for development, staging, and production deployments with proper network share handling.

### What was done

#### 1. Updated Base Docker Compose Configuration
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use Docker mount path `/app/shared`
- Added `shared_storage` volume mount to backend service
- Added volumes section with placeholder configuration

#### 2. Created Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment (`docker-compose.development.yml`)**
- Uses local directory binding for shared storage
- Enables hot reload for development
- No CIFS mounting required
- Created `./backend/shared-dev` directory for local testing

**Staging Environment (`docker-compose.staging.yml`)**
- Mirrors production setup for testing
- Uses CIFS mounting with domain credentials
- Separate staging database configuration
- Created `.env.staging` with staging-specific settings

**Production Environment (`docker-compose.production.yml`)**
- CIFS network share mounting with domain authentication
- Production database and security settings
- Updated `.env.production` with Docker mount paths

#### 3. Created Deployment Scripts

**Development Deployment (`deploy-development.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Uses local shared storage, no network dependencies
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build -d
```

**Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Tests CIFS mounting before production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

**Production Deployment (`deploy-production.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Full production deployment with network share
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build -d
```

#### 4. Created Documentation
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment configuration explanations
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Security considerations and monitoring commands

### Technical Details

**CIFS Volume Configuration:**
```yaml
volumes:
  shared_storage:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "username=${DOMAIN_USERNAME},password=${DOMAIN_PASSWORD},domain=mbma.com,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777"
      device: "//mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia"
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `SHARED_FOLDER_PATH=/app/shared` (Docker mount path)
- `ORIGINAL_SHARED_PATH=\\\\mbma.com\\shared\\...` (Reference)
- `DOMAIN_USERNAME=mbma\prfservice`
- `DOMAIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!`

### Files Modified/Created
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated base configuration
- `docker-compose.development.yml` - New development config
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` - New staging config
- `backend/.env.staging` - New staging environment
- `deploy-development.ps1` - New development deployment script
- `deploy-staging.ps1` - New staging deployment script
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - New deployment documentation
- `backend/shared-dev/` - New development shared directory

### Next Steps
1. Test Docker container network share access in staging environment
2. Validate CIFS mounting with domain credentials
3. Deploy updated Docker configuration to production
4. Monitor network share performance in containerized environment

### Impact
- Enables proper Docker deployment across all environments
- Provides clear separation between development, staging, and production
- Maintains network share access through CIFS mounting
- Improves deployment consistency and reliability script**: `backend/src/scripts/fixApiKeys.ts`
   - Analyzes encryption/decryption issues
   - Safely clears corrupted encrypted data
   - Provides clear remediation steps
