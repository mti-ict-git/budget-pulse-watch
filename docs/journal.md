## 2025-09-18 13:50:42 - Docker Environment Configuration

### Context
Created comprehensive Docker environment configurations for development, staging, and production deployments with proper network share handling.

### What was done

#### 1. Updated Base Docker Compose Configuration
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use Docker mount path `/app/shared`
- Added `shared_storage` volume mount to backend service
- Added volumes section with placeholder configuration

#### 2. Created Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment (`docker-compose.development.yml`)**
- Uses local directory binding for shared storage
- Enables hot reload for development
- No CIFS mounting required
- Created `./backend/shared-dev` directory for local testing

**Staging Environment (`docker-compose.staging.yml`)**
- Mirrors production setup for testing
- Uses CIFS mounting with domain credentials
- Separate staging database configuration
- Created `.env.staging` with staging-specific settings

**Production Environment (`docker-compose.production.yml`)**
- CIFS network share mounting with domain authentication
- Production database and security settings
- Updated `.env.production` with Docker mount paths

#### 3. Created Deployment Scripts

**Development Deployment (`deploy-development.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Uses local shared storage, no network dependencies
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build -d
```

**Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Tests CIFS mounting before production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

**Production Deployment (`deploy-production.ps1`)**
```powershell
# Full production deployment with network share
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build -d
```

#### 4. Created Documentation
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment configuration explanations
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Security considerations and monitoring commands

### Technical Details

**CIFS Volume Configuration:**
```yaml
volumes:
  shared_storage:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "username=${DOMAIN_USERNAME},password=${DOMAIN_PASSWORD},domain=mbma.com,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777"
      device: "//mbma.com/shared/PR_Document/PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia"
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `SHARED_FOLDER_PATH=/app/shared` (Docker mount path)
- `ORIGINAL_SHARED_PATH=\\\\mbma.com\\shared\\...` (Reference)
- `DOMAIN_USERNAME=mbma\prfservice`
- `DOMAIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!`

### Files Modified/Created
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated base configuration
- `docker-compose.development.yml` - New development config
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` - New staging config
- `backend/.env.staging` - New staging environment
- `deploy-development.ps1` - New development deployment script
- `deploy-staging.ps1` - New staging deployment script
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - New deployment documentation
- `backend/shared-dev/` - New development shared directory

### Next Steps
1. Test Docker container network share access in staging environment
2. Validate CIFS mounting with domain credentials
3. Deploy updated Docker configuration to production
4. Monitor network share performance in containerized environment

### Impact
- Enables proper Docker deployment across all environments
- Provides clear separation between development, staging, and production
- Maintains network share access through CIFS mounting
- Improves deployment consistency and reliability script**: `backend/src/scripts/fixApiKeys.ts`
   - Analyzes encryption/decryption issues
   - Safely clears corrupted encrypted data
   - Provides clear remediation steps
